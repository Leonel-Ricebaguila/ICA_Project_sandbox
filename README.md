# ICA Project Sandbox

## 🤔 What is this repository?

Welcome to the ICA Project Sandbox! This is a dedicated space for testing scripts, developing new functions, and debugging code for the ICA project.

If you have a new idea for the project, **this is the right place to prove it!**

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with contributing to this sandbox, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
*   Python (Check `requirements.txt` for the recommended version)
*   Git

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Leonel-Ricebaguila/ICA_Project_sandbox.git
    cd ICA_Project_sandbox
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Please use the same dependencies/libraries as the base code to make it easier to integrate your work with others.*


## 💡 How to Contribute

We encourage everyone to contribute! To keep things organized and efficient, please follow these guidelines:

### 🧹 Code Organization
*   **Please try to make sure that what you do is organized and does not conflict with the code of others.**
*   Create a separate folder for your major feature or experiment if it involves multiple files.
*   Use clear and descriptive names for your files and functions.

### 📝 Committing Your Work
*   **Explain your code when you commit it.** Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
    *   **Good Example:** `"Add new data preprocessing function for image normalization"`
    *   **Bad Example:** `"update script"`

### ✅ Best Practices
1.  **Test your code** before pushing.
2.  **Update the `requirements.txt`** if you add a new library. Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
3.  **Comment your code** so others can understand your logic.
4.  If you are working on a significant new feature, consider creating a new branch.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
